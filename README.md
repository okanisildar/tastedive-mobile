# tastedive-mobile

I developed this mobile application using tastedive public API. Since public API has only very basic feature (by the time I was developing this app) that is searching I could implement searching feature only. This feature finds you similar tasted music, movies etc based on what you search. Public API's type feature was not working so you can only get similar things in the type of what you search. For example, if you search a music band you will get music recommendations only. 

Only tested on IOS platform.

## Available Scripts

If Yarn was installed when the project was initialized, then dependencies will have been installed via Yarn, and you should probably use it to run these commands as well. Unlike dependency installation, command running syntax is identical for Yarn and NPM at the time of this writing.

### `npm install`
or
### `yarn install`

Installs the dependencies for your application.

### `npm start`
or
### `yarn start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.
